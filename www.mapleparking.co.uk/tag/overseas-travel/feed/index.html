<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It comes almost exactly two years after the first Covid lockdown measures were imposed in the UK.</p>

<div class="ssrcss-7uxr49-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1">
<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">We can now enjoy a holiday overseas or visit family and friends without all of the worry, time and money that comes with testing before returning home.  This makes all the difference to families and larger groups and we expect to see demand rise dramatically as people long for sun, sea and sand.</p>

<p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">However, UK travellers are still advised to check the rules for the countries they are visiting &#8211; as many still have restrictions and testing requirements in place, and many require PCR or clear covid tests before entry.</p>
<p>Travel is looking good for 2022, things are easier and confidence is on the rise.  With Easter just around the corner, we expect a good solid turnaround &#8211; and we look forward to welcoming you at the terminal.</p>
