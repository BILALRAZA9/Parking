<p>Back in March we reported that we have received <strong>“The Gold Trusted Service Award” </strong>by Feefo – one of the UK’s leading consumer review platforms.</p>
<p>We joined Feefo so that we could learn and grow, and listen to our customers by understanding more about their experience when parking with us.  We chose Feefo in particular, as reviews were from genuine customers only; people that had actually used our <a href="http://www.mapleparking.co.uk">meet and greet parking</a> service at the airports. People who haven’t used our parking service simply can’t review us on Feefo, so it ensures only our customers can leave feedback, and we can respond to each and every reviewer personally.</p>
<p>It has worked better than we could ever have hoped, and has allowed us to learn and gain insight into what our customers really think of our service.  We are always open to change and improvement and this feedback has highlighted many areas we could improve and areas where things are working well.<br />
In March we had collected around 3000 reviews, and due to maintaining an average score of <a href="https://www.maplemanorparking.net/reviews/">4.5 out of 5</a>, we were awarded<a href="https://trustedservice.feefo.com/"> Feefo’s gold trusted service award.</a> Today, we have nearly 4000 reviews and a score of 4.6 out of 5 and our customer retention has improved massively.</p>
<p>Due to the success of Feefo, we wanted to roll out real reviews on other similar review sites too. We know that nowadays people are careful when using / buying any sort of service, from car rental firms, travel agents, tour operators, airport parking companies and more.  We want to know what we should or could expect from that company or service, from others that have used them.</p>
<p>Most of us will have heard of Trustpilot if we spend a lot of time online. They are a huge review site that describes itself as’</p>
<p><em>“The world’s most powerful review platform, free and open to all. Our mission is to bring people and companies together to create ever-improving experiences for everyone.”</em></p>
<p>Although Trustpilot reviews are open to all to comment, we work with Trustpilot in a similar way to Feefo, and actively invite customers to review after using our meet and greet service. Just like Feefo it is allowing us to gain huge insight into what we are doing right, and areas we can improve on. We are able to hear what our customers are saying, and we are able to write back to them on the site too, which we believe is one of the best and most significant features. We feel that being able to personally respond to each reviewer not only shows how important that customer and their business is to us, but allows us to fix or provide answers and resolutions if any problems that may have occurred. Most importantly, it allows us as a business to constantly improve and grow.</p>
<p>Since working with Trustpilot, we have had nearly 700 people who have parked with us, leave a review, and we’ve gained a rating of ‘great’ or 4/5 stars, which we are really happy about. As with any company or service out there, not every customer will walk away happy, things can go wrong, however, being able to listen to that unhappy customer and offer explanations, apologies or just an assurance that we appreciate and take their comments on board, and will work on improving it, has meant that customers are coming back and using us again and again.</p>
<p>Take a look at our <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/maplemanorparking.net">meet and greet reviews</a> for yourself, there are  mixed and varied responses, and this has given us great insight.</p>
<p>Our customers are what makes our meet and greet parking service successful, so thank you. We feel that ensuring that our customers know how important they are to us, by asking for their thoughts, and by us replying to that feedback, and offering <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/rewards-loyalty/">loyalty discounts</a> and more, we can continue to grow and stay at the top of the airport parking game.</p>
<p>We hope to continue to provide the most convenient airport parking meet and greet in the UK, so we continue to receive such great feedback. If our customers are happy, we are happy!</p>
<p>If you haven’t used out airport parking before, do head to <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/maplemanorparking.net">Trustpilot</a> or <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/reviews/">Feefo</a> and read what our customers are saying about us. If you have used our service in the past and want to leave a review now, you can by all means do so on Trustpilot.</p>
