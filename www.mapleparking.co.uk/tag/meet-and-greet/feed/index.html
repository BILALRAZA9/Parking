										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you are wondering what the difference is between valet parking and Meet and Greet Parking, at the airport.¬† Not that much!¬† Both valet parking and Meet and Greet Parking involve meeting your designated driver outside the terminal, and leaving them to park on your behalf.</p>
<p>Both services are fast, convenient and perfect for families or those who have lots of baggage or prefer to be close to the terminal building, and both offer a parking service which enables the passengers to step straight from their car and go to the departures terminal. It also gives the advantage of coming straight out of the flight and drive in the car which is waiting for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4061" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meet-and-Greet-Stansted.png" alt="Meet and Greet Parking" width="697" height="445" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meet-and-Greet-Stansted.png 697w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meet-and-Greet-Stansted-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></p>
<p>Be sure to look out for Meet and Greet providers who are<strong> Approved</strong> operators working from the meet and greet zone. The meet and greet zone is also just a short walk from the terminal entrance / exit.</p>
<p>As an Approved operator and experienced Meet &amp; Greet Specialist, we know you and your car are in safe hands.¬† Established for over 28 years, we know all there is to know about Meet and Greet Airport Parking and have a whole bunch of accreditations to show for it!¬† Take a look, we want you to know you can trust your car with us.¬† <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/partners-accreditations/">Parking Accreditations.</a></p>
<p>We also want to offer you value for money, so we bring you our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/price-match-guarantee/">Price Match Guarantee</a>, which gives you our word that you won&#8217;t find our branded service anywhere cheaper. <strong>‚ÄúAlways book with us direct for our best prices and to qualify for our loyalty discounts.‚Äù</strong></p>
