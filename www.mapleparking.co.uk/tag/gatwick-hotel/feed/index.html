										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>MAPLE MANOR HOTEL &amp; PARKING</strong></p>
<p>Travelling can be a stressful thing can’t it? Even before you fly there are so many factors to sort out; getting to and from the airport is one of them. Most people prefer to drive their own car; after all, your vehicle has everything you need in terms of car seats for the children, disability aids for the less abled, enough space for all of your luggage and so on. It also allows you to leave when you want and go directly from your door to the airport rather than arrange public transport, which can be expensive and taxing. So driving is definitely the most convenient option but what if your flight is early in the morning, or really late at night? Getting up pre-dawn and driving many hours to the airport or arriving back from your holiday in the middle of night, and then having to drive home, isn’t really ideal or stress free.</p>
<p><strong>STRESS-FREE HOLIDAYS</strong></p>
<p>Going on holiday should be all about relaxing, having fun and de-stressing so how do we make getting to and from the airport hassle free and actually enjoyable? Have you considered staying at an airport hotel before or / and after your flight? Most people assume this is an unnecessary extra cost and expenditure and envisage staying in the typical, run of the mill airport hotels where every room is basic and the same. Although it’ll save the stress and hassle of driving in the middle of the night, then spending more time waiting and actually flying, these types of airport hotel don’t really add any luxury or enjoyment to your journey, meaning people often shelve the idea.</p>

<p><strong>AIRPORT HOTEL WITH A DIFFERENCE</strong></p>
<p>What if there was an airport hotel that did add pleasure to your holiday? What if staying at an airport hotel was a simple extension of your holiday, where you could relax either side of flying and reduce any anxiety or worry?  Well we have come up with just that, an airport hotel with a huge difference.</p>
<p>Here at Maple Parking we are now more than just meet and greet parking specialists. We have our own airport hotel at Gatwick Airport and it’s way more than the standard and dreary airport hotels that you find around Gatwick Airport.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE LET US INTRODUCE, THE MAPLE MANOR HOTEL.</strong></p>
<p>The Maple Parking Hotel is a charming boutique airport hotel with a difference. It offers 12 elegant and newly renovated en-suit bedrooms, a delightful restaurant with mouth-watering fare and a luxurious lounge to relax in, before or after your holiday.</p>
<p>Formally known as the Flight Tavern Public House until 2013, it was a wonderful working partnership between Maple Parking and 5* Hotel The Oakhouse in Somerset, who set out to skilfully restore the Tavern with their expert knowledge. The Oakhouse team were already highly respected in the Hotel sector, bringing their uncompromising approach to delivering first class guest experience in the boutique hotel trade to the project. With Maple Parking’s long history in the Gatwick Airport market, together they aimed to offer “an exciting and unique hotel in the Gatwick area” and that’s just what they did, with The Maple Parking Hotel launching in 2016.</p>
<p>Just 5 minutes from Gatwick airport, hotel guests can either arrange a park and ride from the hotel or simply drive themselves to departures and park with our usual airport meet and greet parking.</p>
<h3>FEATURES &amp; FACILITIES</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 12 rooms are all fresh, spotless and luxuriously appointed featuring; Fluffy bathrobes, White Company Toiletry sets, tea and coffee making facilities, home-baked biscuits and flat screen TVs.</li>
<li>Rooms available to suit all requirements from larger family suites, superior kings, superior twins to accessible rooms with alarms &amp; superior singles for individual or business travellers.</li>
<li>On-site overnight parking is included for those parking at the airport</li>
<li>On-site airport parking packages also available</li>
<li>Just 5 minutes from Gatwick Airport</li>
<li>View of the planes taking off / landing</li>
<li>Licensed Bar</li>
<li>Restaurant with a tasty menu</li>
<li>Comfortable lounge and outside relaxing areas</li>
<li>Prices from just £49 per night</li>
<li>A customer focussed team on-hand 24 hours a day to assist you from the moment you walk through the door, striving to make your stay with us one to remember</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke Sturman, Managing Director of the Oakhouse says of the Maple Parking Hotel;</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on our personable service so if you are ready to take a break from the large corporate hotels book a stay with us and enjoy a night at a small hotel with a big heart.”</p>
<p>Still not convinced staying at an airport hotel is worth it? If you live far away from an airport, if your flight times are too early / late, if you’re already anxious about flying and don’t need any more stress, an airport hotel is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>BENEFITS OF STAYING AT AN AIRPORT HOTEL</strong></p>
<p>Staying at an airport hotel may add a day either before or after your holiday, or potentially both, but there are definitely benefits to staying in airport hotels, and that’s why it’s such a thriving industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LESS HASSLE</strong>– Driving a long-distance to the airport and then getting straight onto a long haul flight will ultimately be tiresome and stressful. Taking your time to get to the airport hotel the day before, enjoying a night there with dinner and getting some sleep will put you in good stead for the flight and holiday. Simply wake up and get a shuttle / drive the very short distance to the airport and you’ll be well rested and stress-free, meaning all you have to do is check in and fly.</li>
<li><strong>LESS MONEY</strong> – It’s actually much cheaper than you think to stay at an airport hotel before or after your flight as many hotels offer park and stay packages with free shuttles to the airport. We have prices from just £49 per night and many <a href="https://www.maplemanorparking.net/packages/">parking packages</a> too.</li>
<li><strong>LESS CHANCE OF THINGS GOING WRONG</strong> – By staying at an airport hotel the night before or after your flight, there’s no rushing and much less chance of running out of time or coming across situations that could make you miss your flight.  Simply enjoy the hotel and when you need to be at the airport, you can be within minutes. No traffic to get stuck in, no missed trains or buses, no car breaking down. You are right there at the airport already, so if things do go wrong, you’ll still be able to catch your flight.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAFETY </strong>– When you’ve just taken a long haul flight and land at 3am, the last thing you need is to drive a few hours home. You’ll be tired, still in holiday mode and knowing the UK it’ll be dark and wet! Taking a 5 minute journey to an airport hotel will allow you to rest before you drive home the next day meaning you’ll be fresh, awake and ready for the day.</li>
</ul>
