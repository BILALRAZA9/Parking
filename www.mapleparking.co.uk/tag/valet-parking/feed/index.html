										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you are wondering what the difference is between valet parking and Meet and Greet Parking, at the airport.  Not that much!  Both valet parking and Meet and Greet Parking involve meeting your designated driver outside the terminal, and leaving them to park on your behalf.</p>
<p>Both services are fast, convenient and perfect for families or those who have lots of baggage or prefer to be close to the terminal building, and both offer a parking service which enables the passengers to step straight from their car and go to the departures terminal. It also gives the advantage of coming straight out of the flight and drive in the car which is waiting for you.</p>
