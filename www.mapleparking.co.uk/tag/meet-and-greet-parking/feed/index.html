<strong>SUPPORTING YOU. STANDING TOGETHER</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you are wondering what the difference is between valet parking and Meet and Greet Parking, at the airport.  Not that much!  Both valet parking and Meet and Greet Parking involve meeting your designated driver outside the terminal, and leaving them to park on your behalf.</p>
<p>Both services are fast, convenient and perfect for families or those who have lots of baggage or prefer to be close to the terminal building, and both offer a parking service which enables the passengers to step straight from their car and go to the departures terminal. It also gives the advantage of coming straight out of the flight and drive in the car which is waiting for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4061" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meet-and-Greet-Stansted.png" alt="Meet and Greet Parking" width="697" height="445" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meet-and-Greet-Stansted.png 697w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meet-and-Greet-Stansted-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></p>
<p>Be sure to look out for Meet and Greet providers who are<strong> Approved</strong> operators working from the meet and greet zone. The meet and greet zone is also just a short walk from the terminal entrance / exit.</p>
<p>As an Approved operator and experienced Meet &amp; Greet Specialist, we know you and your car are in safe hands.  Established for over 28 years, we know all there is to know about Meet and Greet Airport Parking and have a whole bunch of accreditations to show for it!  Take a look, we want you to know you can trust your car with us.  <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/partners-accreditations/">Parking Accreditations.</a></p>
<p>We also want to offer you value for money, so we bring you our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/price-match-guarantee/">Price Match Guarantee</a>, which gives you our word that you won&#8217;t find our branded service anywhere cheaper. <strong>“Always book with us direct for our best prices and to qualify for our loyalty discounts.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>The well-known BBC Rogue Traders have been recently investigating an airport parking company at Gatwick airport, due to a high level of complaints and reports that cars were parked in local fields, without any security measures in place, despite what was being advertised on the booking site.</p>
<p>Customers were booking their parking via a third party website, trusting claims that there was CCTV in operation, security fencing and a gated entrance, when in fact cars were being left in unsecured areas and keys were found in a car boot.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It is companies like this one which are not approved by Gatwick, do not treat customer’s cars fairly and have little or no facilities in place to securely take care of your car that causes such harm to the ones who do.  We would like customers to be aware of such companies and to know how to identify them so that they can be avoided at all costs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We understand that booking your parking on the basis of price alone is very tempting, however paying a lower price to a company who do not have the correct facilities/staff/security or CCTV in place, needed to take care of your car, can dramatically increase the risk of something going wrong.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Here are 4 ways you can ensure you are dealing with a reputable meet and greet company. </strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-677" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/how-why-maple.png" alt="Maple Parking safe" width="764" height="125" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/how-why-maple.png 764w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/how-why-maple-300x49.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /></p>
<p>1. When parking at Gatwick, look out for companies who are part of the <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/partners-accreditations/">Approved Operator Scheme</a>. This has been created and granted by the airport themselves and aims to provide reassurance to the customer that the company are providing safe, secure, professional meet and greet parking.</p>
<p><strong>Maple Parking is fully approved by Gatwick Airport to provide meet and greet parking services at both the North and South Terminals.  Take a look at our partners and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/partners-accreditations/">accreditations here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>2. Always look out for the <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/latest-news/park-mark-award/">Park Mark</a> logo when making your booking. This means the parking facility has been police assessed and is secure.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Maple Parking hold the Park Mark® Safer Parking award – a national police-backed initiative which is given to parking facilities that are properly managed and maintained and provide a safe environment for both vehicles and customers.</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>3. Always book with a member of the Independent Airport Parking Association as they are assessed to prove they provide the highest levels of professionalism and service.</p>
<p><strong>Maple Parking are one of only a handful of companies who are members of The Independent Airport Parking Association– or the IAPA for short. Its members are asked to promote best practices and raise standards to ensure care and professionalism.  We have recently won the IAPA <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/maple-parkings-independent-airport-parking-association-award/">‘Best Meet &amp; Greet Operator’</a> in the UK nonetheless!</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>3. And last but not least – always take the time to read through recent customer feedback. A great way of understanding how other passengers rate their experience with the company.</p>
<p><strong>Maple Parking score highly and is rated EXCELLENT, please feel free to read genuine <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/reviews/">reviews</a> from real travellers by <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/reviews/">clicking here.</a></strong></p>

<p>So you may of heard of meet and greet parking, perhaps you’ve heard it called valet parking too? Maybe you have never heard of it before? Well, it has been our forte at Gatwick Airport for over 20 years so we wanted to make sure that everyone knows not only how it works, but what they should expect from this sort of airport parking.</p>
<p>The biggest assumption about <a href="http://www.maplemanorparking.net">meet and greet parking </a>is that it’s expensive, and you can see why people would think that as it’s the easiest and most convenient way to park at Gatwick, or any other airport for that matter. However, what most people don’t know is that, often, it can actually be much cheaper than any other way to park, or any other way of getting to <a href="https://www.maplemanorparking.net/airport/airport-parking-gatwick/">Gatwick Airport</a>.<br />
Here we’ll explain how it works, what to expect from your meet and greet parking company, and then we’ll highlight the perks and compare it to other ways of parking and getting to the airport.</p>
<p>WHAT IS MEET AND GREET PARKING?<br />
Quite simply put, meet and greet parking (or valet parking) is where a company park your car for you. You see it all the time in Hollywood films; people turn up to a fancy hotel and there’s a bus boy waiting for them. The car owner gets out, hands over their keys and walks straight into reception whilst the parking attendant take time to park their car for them. When they want to leave, the car will be outside the hotel waiting for them again, so they can immediately depart, no hassle.</p>
<p>Meet and greet parking is basically exactly the same system at the airport; you drive to the departure terminal and a company, like ourselves Maple Parking, will park your car for you at the airport. When you return, your car will be at arrivals so you get on your way, quick and easy.</p>
<p>HOW IT WORKS<br />
Here are the stages you will go through with us after your flights / holidays are booked;</p>
<div id="attachment_1395" style="width: 654px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1395" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1395 size-full" src="https://www.maplemanorparking.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meet-and-greet-parking.png" alt="How does it work?" width="644" height="245" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meet-and-greet-parking.png 644w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meet-and-greet-parking-300x114.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1395" class="wp-caption-text">How does meet and greet work?</p></div>

• Your driver will conduct a quick check over your car with you, they’ll take photographs and then confirm your return details<br />
• You are then free to take the short walk straight into departures to check in and catch your flight<br />
• Our professional drivers will then drive and park your car for you, in our highly secure car parks, near to the airport, until your day of return</p>

• Call us when you have collected your luggage and are ready for your car.<br />
• Your driver will meet you outside of the arrivals terminal with your car, exactly as you left it.<br />

It really is as simple as that! You can even get your car washed / valeted whilst you’re away so you come back to a sparkly clean car.</p>
<p>But&#8230;.WHY MEET AND GREET?<br />
There are many reasons why meet and greet parking is, in our opinion, the best way to park at an airport. But here are a few of the most important reasons;<br />
• Fastest way to park at the airport – Because we park your car, it eliminates the whole parking process. Simply turn up to departures, walk in and we’ll do the rest<br />
• Easiest way to park at the airport – no parking to do, no shuttles to catch, no public transport to get &#8211; head straight to departures<br />
• Safest way to park at the airport – for your car, which will be monitored 24/7, and for yourself as you won’t have to walk to far away car parks in the dark after a late flight<br />
• Convenient for all travellers – you don’t have to haul yourself, luggage, children, disability aids etc. onto shuttles or public transport.<br />
• Cheap airport parking – meet and greet parking is MUCH cheaper than people think, it can often be cheaper than onsite airport parking<br />
• Closest parking to the airport – Since you don’t have to park your car, it’s the closest you’ll get to the terminal building than any other way of parking at the airport.</p>
<p>WHO IS MEET AND GREET GOOD FOR?<br />
Meet and greet parking can be used by any type of traveller but we describe below why it is particularly good for certain travellers depending on their needs<br />
• Families – drive their own family cars with everything they need like buggy space and car seats, straight to the terminal. No hassle of hauling little ones around just to get to the airport<br />
• Disabled – the best service for the less abled in our eyes. They can drive their own disability equipped cars to departures and have no other hassles<br />
• Elderly – Eliminates the stress of shuttles and long walks from car parks for the elderly<br />
• Business – for business travellers with little time, meet and greet is perfect as it’s the fastest way to park at the airport.<br />
• Groups / Teams – with lots of luggage and lots of people to negotiate, meet and greet eliminates the stress for the organisers / leaders and the team too</p>

<p><strong>Why Choose Meet and Greet Airport Parking</strong>?</p>
<p>Are you a frequent business flyer? Do you fly from the UK regularly? Are you going on holiday soon with your family, friends or sports / school group? If so, you need to know the name Maple Parking. Many passengers use expensive means like taxis to get to the airport, or park their car in overpriced onsite airport parking spaces far from the terminal. Others struggle with luggage and / or children on public transport to try and save a little money. The good news is, you can now drive straight to the departure terminal in your own car, and let us park your car for you, without breaking the bank.  <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">Meet and Greet Airport Parking</a>, is quick, easy and the only way to park.</p>
<p>The UK’s largest independent <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet airport parking</a> provider, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/">Maple Parking</a> has been taking the airport parking industry by storm for over 22 years. Committed to value for money, trust and peace of mind, we pride ourselves on our customer service, making clients come back to us over and over again.

<p><strong>Our meet and greet parking is perfect for;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Families &#8211; who don’t want to haul their luggage and children onto public transport, or into taxis without baby seats. They can easily pack their own car, drive from home, straight up to the departure terminal. No transfers, or walks from car parks needed.</li>
<li>Disabled clients &#8211; who have specialist cars for their needs. It is important for these customers especially, that they drive their own car as close to the terminal as possible, and meet the airport assisted service staff.</li>
<li>Elderly flyers &#8211; Walking from car parks in our harsh UK weather, or getting airport shuttles, can be stressful and unnecessary. We serve 1000’s of elderly passengers who love the ease and comfort of our meet and greet parking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/business-travellers/">Frequent Business travellers</a> &#8211; These regular flyers make up a large portion of our clientele.

When you are flying so regularly, saving that time and money makes a huge difference to stress levels!</li>
</ul>
