										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve had traffic light systems, mandatory fit to fly and PCR tests, self isolation rules and costly and compulsory hotel quarantines. It’s safe to say that over the past few months and years, one of our favourite things to do, travel, hasn&#8217;t been easy. At some points it’s not even been possible! This has been a sad state of affairs for all travel companies like ours, airport parking. We definitely had quiet times when the travel restrictions were at their strictest, but fortunately travel has been picking up more and more over the last few months as more countries start opening their borders to us.</p>
<p>We also have some more good, actually great news! These travel restrictions and guidelines are being amended again on Monday 4th October, and this time they’re;</p>
<ul>
<li>More simple</li>
<li>Not as strict</li>
<li>Cheaper!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is really exciting for the airlines, travel companies, the airports themselves, us as an airport parking business, and yourselves as the people wanting to travel and go on holiday to lands afar (or further than the UK anyway!).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4436" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice.png" alt="Advice for Travel" width="925" height="618" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice.png 1169w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice-300x200.png 300w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice-1024x684.png 1024w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice-768x513.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p>The changes look positive, and although we advise everyone to listen to the full announcement on Monday, we want to give you a quick summary of what we can (hope!) to expect!</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye to the traffic light system</strong></p>
<p>We have had so many of our airport parking customers enquire about what list (green, amber or red) their destination is on. It’s often been a tricky task, as it’s been changing too!</p>
<p>However, from the 4th October 2021, there will simply be <u>one red lis</u>t which is home to all the countries that are still suffering badly with Covid 19, and are a risk to the UK if masses travel to / from them.</p>
<p>On this list of 54 countries there’s much of South America, most of central and Southern Africa including South Africa itself, Thailand, Peru, Mayanmar, The Philippines, Afghanistan and more.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the ‘rest of the world’ list, which is basically all the rest of the countries in the World that we can (from the 4th October) travel to more easily.</p>
<p>It’s even better news for the fully vaccinated too, with quarantine, self-isolation, pre-departure and day 8 arrival tests all being scrapped for them.</p>
<p>There are rules to being <em>fully</em> vaccinated such as travelling at least 14 days after vaccination and having approved vaccines only, so ensure that you check that you definitely qualify for <em>fully</em> vaccinated before you book.</p>
<p>For the partially or unvaccinated, although you might still have to self isolate and have a negative PCR test before and after travel, the tests will be said to be a little cheaper, with chances to also have a test to release afterwards.</p>
<p>Remember, just because the UK government says we can now travel to another country, that country might not want to accept us yet. It’s super important to check both our government, and your destination’s rules before flying.</p>
<p>At Maple we are excited about these changes and we are ready to start parking more and more of our customers at the airports again. We are still running our long and short stay parking, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet parking</a> at all UK airports including <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-airport-stansted/">Stansted</a>, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-parking-gatwick/">Gatwick</a>, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-heathrow/">Heathrow</a> and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-birmingham/">Birmingham</a> airports. We will also be maintaining our covid safe measures like extra cleanliness and social distancing as much as possible, as well as keeping our more flexible way of booking (if things do change again).</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you all again soon!</p>
<p>To book head to our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/">website</a>, email us <a href="mailto:bookings@mapleparking.co.uk">bookings@mapleparking.co.uk</a> at or call us on 03 333 222 333</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the biggest <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/about-us/">airport parking companies</a> in the UK, we are used to serving 100’s of holidaymakers, business travellers, and solo adventurers, daily. We, ordinarily, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet</a> our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/rewards-loyalty/">loyal</a> customers at most of the <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/">airports in the UK,</a> ensuring their cars are safe and secure whilst they take a few days, weeks and even months away in other countries.</p>
<p>As we all know many industries have suffered terribly through the pandemic. Mainly the industries that serve us outdoors, allow us to travel, explore, be with nature, eat and drink in different places apart from our own houses and gardens! On the flip side of this, the companies and industries that serve our indoors have boomed and prospered. We’ve gardened, shopped online, made all kinds of things, watched ALL the series, had restaurant meal kits delivered so we can, for just a moment, feel like we are eating somewhere other than our own dining room!</p>
<p>One thing we all haven’t been able to do of course is travel, go abroad, fly to other countries whether to holiday, work or see family and friends. The travel industry has been hit hard by this pandemic, and big names like Flybe, STA Travel and even travel giants Thomas Cook have unfortunately gone into administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Is there a new light at the end of the tunnel?</em></strong></p>
<p>After a couple of years of being much quieter than usual, and fortunately keeping our heads above the water, we are starting to get phone calls and emails once again. In fact, since Monday, we have been pretty much inundated with airport parking enquiries, and even bookings, across all <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/">the airports </a>we offer parking and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet</a> at.  This is no surprise to us to be honest as we have been following the ‘roadmap’ on tenterhooks, awaiting the day that the UK is allowed to travel and fly, once again.</p>
<p>Foreign holidays are currently banned, as we know, but on Monday (3rd May) the British government announced that travel will be able to slowly resume, in the next few weeks, from May 17th!</p>
<p>Of course many MPs, and the British public alike, are super wary of opening up too fast and then seeing a rise in cases once again, and it seems that Boris Johnson agrees with this too.</p>
<p><em>“We do want to do some opening up on May 17 but I don’t think that the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. I certainly don’t and we have got to be very, very tough, and we have got to be as cautious as we can, whilst we continue to open up.” </em>the Prime Minister is quoted as saying  to reporters this week.</p>
<p><strong><em>So what travel restrictions have changed?</em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em>There will be further announcements, but at the moment, this is what we know.</p>
<p>A traffic light system is going to be introduced where countries that we can travel to / from will be classed as GREEN, AMBER or RED.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you travel to a ‘green country’, you won’t have to stay in a quarantine hotel or isolate whatsoever on your return, but you will need a negative covid test.</li>
<li>If you travel to an ‘amber country’, you will need a negative covid test and have to isolate for 10 days, but again you won’t have to stay in a quarantine hotel on your return.</li>
<li>Travelling to ‘red countries’ will be the strictest, and only UK / Irish nationals will be able to return, as well as getting tested and having to stay and pay for a government quarantine hotel for 10 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of publishing this article, we still don’t know what countries will be on the coveted ‘green list’ but there is much speculation running through every media outlet in the UK and Europe, with some suggesting that there will be at most a dozen countries only, which might include Portugal, Spain and perhaps Greece.</p>
<p><em><strong>So is it safe to book a holiday now?</strong> </em></p>
<p>As we said, we have already received many airport parking bookings, especially at our busiest airports of <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-airport-stansted/">Stansted</a>, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-parking-gatwick/">Gatwick</a> and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-heathrow/">Heathrow.</a> People are desperate to get some sunshine, to see family and friends abroad, and we very much expected it to be the case following the first announcement that travel restrictions would start to be lifted.</p>
<p>We also think that it’s because we offer <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/travel-support-during-covid-19/">travel support during covid-19</a>, and have completely rewritten our bookings and cancellation policy to move with these unpredictable times. Customers are now safe in the knowledge that, if their holiday or flight gets cancelled, they can change, edit and rearrange with <u>no penalties or charges. </u></p>
<p>We think if you are really eager to book your holiday, please check the company&#8217;s cancellation and refund policies. Many, like ourselves, will have amended them to move with the current situation. However, many will not have and you don’t want to book a holiday, flights, transfers and airport parking, if you then can’t get anything back if covid strikes, yet again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What is Maple’s new booking and cancellation policy?</em></strong></p>
<p>As we said, you can now <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/booking-with-maple-parking/select-a-booking/">book airport parking </a>through <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/">Maple</a> with total flexibility and peace of mind.</p>
<p>CHANGE, EDIT AND REISSUE YOUR BOOKING WITH NO PENALTIES/CHARGES.</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL customers will be able to <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/booking-with-maple-parking/select-a-booking/">book airport parking</a> across our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/">network of airports</a>, with the peace of mind that, should your travel dates change, there will be no change or reissuance fees. Only a difference in fare, if applicable, will apply.</li>
<li>If you are not able to reissue your travel dates, we will happily give you a credit note for the same amount, to ensure you are able to book as and when your dates come through. This is again, completely free of charge.</li>
<li>If you must cancel, simply give us 24 hours’ notice and we will release your dates and offer you a full refund.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are travel companies doing to keep customers safe from covid when they travel?</p>
<p>This is another question and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/covid-19/keeping-you-and-your-car-safe-with-maple-parking/">policy</a> we’ve been working really hard on over the last few months. The last thing we want is an outbreak between our customers and staff, and we only hope that all travel companies from airport buses and transfers, to airlines and the airports themselves will be following the strictest protocols when they start seeing more and more travellers come through their doors.</p>
<p><em>Here’s what </em><a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk"><em>Maple</em></a><em> have done to keep customers safe and to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Our new <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/covid-19/keeping-you-and-your-car-safe-with-maple-parking/">operating guidelines</a> will ensure that we always maintain social distancing as well as no contact for all drivers and passengers.</li>
<li>All staff will wear PPE and will administer hand sanitizer on their gloves before and after each customer AND vehicle interaction.</li>
<li>All staff have been fully trained to work in this different environment and to follow all of our new health and safety protocols.</li>
<li>Customers will be offered antibacterial wipes to use on their steering wheel, gear shift and hand controls prior to driving home.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the PMs’ announcement on February 22nd, we all have an extra spring in our step, and can see a little glimmer of light, in the hope that this summer, we could be enjoying holidays once more.</p>
<p>After what feels like a lifetime without travel, and the magic of seeing friends and family and enjoying the sun on our faces, we set to fly again and we imagine, travel deals will literally take off!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4088" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021.png" alt="" width="662" height="378" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021.png 1269w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021-300x171.png 300w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021-768x439.png 768w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></p>
<p><strong>All guidance is updated as often as possible in accordance with UK Government. Last updated February 23rd 2021.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do we know about holidays this year?</strong><br />
A decision about overseas travel will be made on April 12th. But Possibly as early as 17th May, if phase three begins and the success of the vaccine continues to head in the same direction.</p>
<p>UK holidays will resume in self-contained accommodation, and 12th April is also the date on which the Department for Transport will publish its review on when overseas travel can resume.</p>
<p><strong>Where will we be able to go?</strong><br />
There is a lot to consider, and it is important to get vaccinated to be welcomed without quarantine. What we know is that the usual holiday destinations like; Spain, Greece and Cyprus for example are keen to get us back, and so if the vaccine programmes continue and there are no new variants, it is realistic to expect to see the travel corridor open slowly but surely over the coming weeks.<br />
We also know that cruises are making headway too &#8211; and are actively making plans for vaccinated travellers to get back on board; this is good news for many who are waiting to rebook, or prefer getaways by sea.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine Rules</strong><br />
The vaccine is currently not mandatory, however The International Air Transport Association (IATA) have created a digital pass for those that have received the jab to verify their vaccination to Border Control forces. This acts as a ‘pass’ for travellers and would mean we would no longer need the hotel quarantines and mandatory tests as we currently have.<br />
There are also a number of travel operators who have confirmed that they won’t be turning away unvaccinated travellers, however, this does not mean that they visiting country share in the same vein.</p>
<p><strong>When can I book my holiday?</strong><br />
Anytime! although booking sooner rather than later could see you save BIG. It is likely that as time goes on, and demand increases, prices will rise quite dramatically.</p>
<p>At this time, holiday operators are offering attractive ‘get back travelling’ packages although with travel set to boom later this year, and with so many delaying their holidays, it’s looking busier than ever.</p>
<p>Be sure to spend some time getting the right insurance policy and a booking with a reputable travel company, and you should be covered for all eventualities – as many are offering flexible change and cancellation due to the shambles of 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“A cloudy day is no match for a sunny disposition”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3845" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Beach-Holiday.png" alt="Beach Holiday " width="580" height="385" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Beach-Holiday.png 675w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Beach-Holiday-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>But how do we achieve this during a pandemic? It prevents our previous and endless opportunities to travel, enjoying the winter escapes we all so desperately crave. Nonetheless, rest at ease and feel reassured that you can just as well, secure a last-minute getaway to countless destinations including; Cyprus, Italy, Portugal and many more. With the restrictions described, you’re able to travel without the consequence of a two-week quarantine. This is something I am certain will benefit you!</p>
<p><strong>Captivating Cyprus</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, is exempt from the FCDO advice against essential travel, meaning tourists are permitted and encouraged to visit and enjoy the luxuries the country has to offer. As long as you provide a negative test result upon arrival, obtained 72 hours before travel. In addition, children under the age of 12 do not require a test. All travellers must complete a <a href="https://cyprusflightpass.gov.cy/">CYPRUS FLIGHT PASS</a>, available on the Cyprud Flight Pass Website. You are responsible for ensuring you provide the correct details to guarantee your straightforward travel to tranquillity.</p>
<p>With it’s blue skies and perfect year-round weather, the beautiful sandy beaches, water sports and expansive coastlines are not to be overlooked. Cyprus&#8217;s world-famous food, are specifically halloumi cheese, olives, hummus, calamari and kebabs. Ultimately, the most peaceful place, with contrasting rugged mountains and picturesque countryside.</p>
<p><strong>Playful Portugal</strong></p>
<p>Such a populat destination, but, before arrival you must complete <a href="https://portugalcleanandsafe.pt/en/passenger-locator-card">A PASSENGER LOCATOR CARD</a>. Although, it is exempt from the two week quarantine requirement you will be subject to health screening on arrival at mainland airports and ports. Your temperature will be checked, if it is 38 degrees or over you will be referred to the health authorities and expected to take a COVID-19 test and finally to self-isolate until your results are known.</p>
<p>This destination has it all: historic cities, natural landscapes, world-renowned cuisine, and the most spectacular beaches. With special radiance, it’s renowned for sun, sea and beach adventures. Its natural sunny spells are a great way to achieve a relaxing getaway.</p>
<p><strong>Irresistible Italy</strong></p>
<p>You must show evidence of a positive test result when you arrive, however, you cannot use the NHS testing services to receive a test. This should be arranged privately. Alternatively, you can take a test upon arrival at the airport, however you will have to self isolate in your accommodation until you receive your results. Seeing that you issue all the requirements you are able to enter the country.</p>
<p>Pizza, pasta, wine, art, fashion, vespas! &#8220;The city of love”, this country offers wonderful museums, beautiful scenery and adventurous cities. One of the greatest joys is discovering first hand that it is, indeed, a dream destination.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, last minute 2020 getaways have never been more desirable. Ensure you organise your entry requirements and you’re good to go!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pandemic which slowly crept around the world, has calmed, but not gone. As we all struggle to get used to the new normal of staying indoors, we look at what is happening outdoors and how safe it is to venture.</p>
<p>Countries around the world are beginning to open, to allow visitors in and to move closer to a post pandemic way of life. For many a summer break was not possible, but perhaps it is, we are certainly seeing more travellers getting on planes and airlines are reinstating routes across the globe, to many countries who were before closed.<br />
Airport travel is going to look different for some time, and although airlines are working hard to keep all passengers safe and secure, there are a number of ways you can help too.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3507" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protection-on-the-plane.png" alt="Protection on the plane" width="668" height="445" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protection-on-the-plane.png 620w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protection-on-the-plane-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p>Expect to wear a face mask, practice physical distancing, and wiping and washing as often as necessary. Whenever possible, travellers should practice social distancing when they are going through security, boarding, and using airport services and facilities. There will be many facilities that are closed, or not able to serve you, and there will be limited refreshments on offer, and in most cases, no drinks and food on the planes at all.  When you board the plane, you will notice that seating arrangements have been changed to ensure social distancing measures can be observed. Families and groups travelling together will, however, be able to sit together.  In some areas of the airport, one-way flows will be in place.</p>
<p>There are a number of preventive safety measures by some of the major and busiest international airports to prevent the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19). If you are travelling from <a href="https://www.gatwickairport.com/">Gatwick airport</a> or <a href="https://www.heathrow.com/">Heathrow airport</a>, do take time to check before you leave to catch your flight.  Both have introduced a number of measures to keep you safe and protected.</p>
<p>Rest assured if you book your <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet airport parking</a>, your booking will be covered by our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/travel-support-during-covid-19/">flexible change policy</a>, allowing you to edit, change or cancel up to two hours before.  We want you to book airport parking with complete peace of mind.</p>
