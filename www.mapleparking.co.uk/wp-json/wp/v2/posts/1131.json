Some people boycott it with singles nights, some plan exuberant nights or weekends away, some may just have a cosy night in with dinner, whilst others may be away from their other halves completely. We all have different stories and plans for this day, from proposing marriage to the love of your life to proposing going for a drink with your best mate!<\/p>\n<p>Many people also take \u2018love being in the air\u2019 to the most literal sense and, just for this day of amor, will fly home to their person, fly to their family and a staggering amount will surprise their partners with a romantic getaway abroad. Now, as we all probably know, airports are probably the most unromantic of places. They\u2019re busy and crowded so you have no privacy, the lighting is bright and brash and not flattering at all, and although most airports have restaurants and eateries, they\u2019re not going to be geared up for a dreamy date!<\/p>\n<p>However, if you do see yourself in an airport this Valentine\u2019s day, we\u2019ve got some great tips on how to make it as romantic as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Surprising \/ picking up your loved one from the airport<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Make sure you know their itinerary and \/ or flight number<\/u>\u00a0 &#8211; This will keep you in the know about when to arrive, as well as letting you check if they\u2019re going to be late or delayed. Sometimes this can be tricky if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re picking them up, as why would you need a flight number? If you don\u2019t want to give the game away, casually ask what time they\u2019re flying. You can then go all \u2018Inspector Morse\u2019 and log onto the live departures \/ arrivals section of the airports websites, and keep checking for updates, so you\u2019re not too early or too late.<\/li>\n<li><u>Make sure you know where you\u2019re going<\/u> \u2013 Many airports have various terminals depending on airlines or international \/ domestic flights. They can be hard to navigate, especially the bigger ones like Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted. Take a look at the airports websites; ensure you know how to get there, as well as where to go when you arrive. If you\u2019re parking at the airport, also work out how long the shuttle or walk is, or where to go for meet and greet parking.<\/li>\n<li><u>Meet them inside the airport, at the arrivals gate<\/u> \u2013 So this may seem obvious, especially if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re picking them up, but definitely go in to meet them. Don\u2019t sit outside in the pickup area and just text saying \u2018surprise\u2019 you\u2019re here! No, the whole point is for them to walk out and see their lover, when they least expected it!<\/li>\n<li><u><a href=\"http:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/\">Use Meet &amp; Greet Parking<\/a><\/u> \u2013 So you definitely need to ditch the car and go in and meet them at the gate as we just said, but we also think using valet or meet and greet parking is, by far, the most romantic way to get your loved one from an airport. Not only is this the easiest way for you, it\u2019s chic and stylish and really shows that you\u2019ve thought this out for them. You get to easily drive up to the airport and not mess around parking and, when you have your partner in tow, effortlessly walk out of arrivals and your car will be right there, warm and ready to go. No bumbling through dark car parks, no long shuttle buses. Just a little touch of luxury, at very little cost! Meet and greet parking is available at nearly all UK airports now from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/gatwick\/\">Gatwick<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/heathrow\/\">Heathrow<\/a> airport, to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/birmingham\/\">Birmingham<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/edinburgh\/\">Edinburgh<\/a> airports and more.<\/li>\n<li><u>Bring a small gift of affection<\/u> &#8211; Now for many women flowers would be wonderful, but not everyone likes flowers. Plus, you may be on your way out rather than going straight home from the airport. It doesn\u2019t need to be a big expensive present, just a small token of love to show that you\u2019re excited to see them. It could be their favourite coffee, a box of chocolates or sweets, a bottle of fizz or anything that you know they like!<\/li>\n<li><u>Make a sign<\/u> \u2013 So this might not be for everyone, but haven\u2019t we all seen a Rom Com where lovers meet at an airport and they make signs?! It\u2019s a very charming way to say \u2018welcome home\u2019.\u00a0 It will also help them not miss you completely as, remember, they won\u2019t be looking for or expecting you. Whether it\u2019s adorned in pink and red giant hearts, has a mushy message or is simply their name, we think it\u2019s a really romantic gesture that would make even the most serious person smile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How to plan a surprise Valentine\u2019s holiday<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many hopeless romantics plan surprise getaways, here\u2019s a few tips to make it go smoothly at the airport.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Make the arrangements<\/u> \u2013 From picking the destination and booking the flights \/ hotels to setting an itinerary, you\u2019ll have to do it all. One stop travel sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.expedia.co.uk\/\">Expedia<\/a> are good to get everything in the same place so you don\u2019t have lots of separate bookings.<\/li>\n<li><u>Make a cover story<\/u> \u2013 People choose to do this is different ways. Some will say they\u2019re going on a UK break away (so their partner packs themselves and has some clue that they\u2019re going away), others will completely surprise them and have to do everything for them. Whatever your story, play it cool and try not to let it slip!<\/li>\n<li><u>Packing for your partner<\/u> \u2013 Even if they have packed to go somewhere \u2018fake\u2019, you\u2019re going to need to make sure that they\u2019re going to have everything they need whilst away; bikinis for sunshine, gloves for snow etc. Also try and do some homework beforehand and take note of all the cosmetics they use daily. Imagine if your man had put so much effort into making sure you had everything you needed because he took the time to investigate. Romantic indeed.<\/li>\n<li><u>Make them wear a blindfold<\/u> \u2013 Have you ever done, or had this done to you, when you\u2019re getting or giving a surprise? Not only is it sexy, but it makes the whole experience so much more exciting and romantic! They\u2019ll be solely relying on their senses and your voice and taking your hand as a lead.\u00a0 Give it a try! If you really don\u2019t want them to know they\u2019re in an airport add ear plugs to this too. Otherwise, they\u2019ll know exactly where they are as soon as they hear the airport sounds.<\/li>\n<li><u>Getting to \/ parking the airport<\/u> \u2013 OK so again we feel that the only way to do this easily is to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/\">book meet and greet parking<\/a>, especially if your other half is in a blindfold! It\u2019s perfect as you simply drop the car outside departures and walk in. If you had to park your car at the airport yourself and walk, or get a shuttle, the romance and their patience will definitely start to dwindle. It shows forward planning, and it\u2019ll add a touch of class when you arrive back too; you\u2019ll simply exit arrivals, jump into your car and drive away.<\/li>\n<li><u>Book an airport lounge<\/u> \u2013 If you\u2019re going all out, why not do it in style and book a lounge as a big gesture of romance? As we said above, airports are not sexy!\u00a0 The crowds, the lights, the stag parties at the bar; not the best setting when you\u2019ve already gone to so much effort. Show them a little luxury and head to the airport lounge. They\u2019ll be quieter, the lights won\u2019t be as bright and you can relax and have a drink in a much smarter and romantic setting.<\/li>\n<li><u>Think about the big reveal<\/u> \u2013 If they have no clue and are blindfolded \/ ear plugged, you need to choose a good time to reveal where you are \/ or where you\u2019re going. Unfortunately they can\u2019t be blindfolded when checking in so it\u2019s going to have to be at the departure entrance, or maybe a sign showing your destination inside, or maybe even at the check in counter as you hand them their passport! If they\u2019re not blindfolded they will realise as you start driving into the airport, either way, keep the reveal in mind. It\u2019s your pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance and their moment of surprise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However you find yourself at an airport this Valentines, whether is surprising someone or being surprised yourself, we hope these tips have helped to make it as romantic as possible.
