Maybe you have never heard of it before? Well, it has been our forte at Gatwick Airport for over 20 years so we wanted to make sure that everyone knows not only how it works, but what they should expect from this sort of airport parking.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest assumption about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\">meet and greet parking <\/a>is that it\u2019s expensive, and you can see why people would think that as it\u2019s the easiest and most convenient way to park at Gatwick, or any other airport for that matter. However, what most people don\u2019t know is that, often, it can actually be much cheaper than any other way to park, or any other way of getting to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-parking-gatwick\/\">Gatwick Airport<\/a>.<br \/>\nHere we\u2019ll explain how it works, what to expect from your meet and greet parking company, and then we\u2019ll highlight the perks and compare it to other ways of parking and getting to the airport.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT IS MEET AND GREET PARKING?<br \/>\nQuite simply put, meet and greet parking (or valet parking) is where a company park your car for you. You see it all the time in Hollywood films; people turn up to a fancy hotel and there\u2019s a bus boy waiting for them. The car owner gets out, hands over their keys and walks straight into reception whilst the parking attendant take time to park their car for them. When they want to leave, the car will be outside the hotel waiting for them again, so they can immediately depart, no hassle.<\/p>\n<p>Meet and greet parking is basically exactly the same system at the airport; you drive to the departure terminal and a company, like ourselves Maple Parking, will park your car for you at the airport. When you return, your car will be at arrivals so you get on your way, quick and easy.<\/p>\n<p>HOW IT WORKS<br \/>\nHere are the stages you will go through with us after your flights \/ holidays are booked;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1395\" style=\"width: 654px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1395\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1395 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/meet-and-greet-parking.png\" alt=\"How does it work?\" width=\"644\" height=\"245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/meet-and-greet-parking.png 644w, https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/meet-and-greet-parking-300x114.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1395\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How does meet and greet work?<\/p><\/div>\n<p>You can find the best quote online using our website, the prices are all present and correct, and if you&#8217;re a new customer, you will receive 10% off, no quibbles.<br \/>\nIf you prefer, we also have a booking team, who are available from 8.30am &#8211; 5.30pm Monday to Friday on: <strong>03 333 222 333.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simply select the your departure date and time, and your expected time of arrival (flight landing time) and the system will generate a free package quote for you.<br \/>\nOnce you have booked, you will receive a confirmation email containing all the details you need, full instructions and directions to our meeting point.<br \/>\nFor a free quote, click here: www.maplemanorparking.net<\/p>\n<p>We currently operate from 7 airports in the UK:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-edinburgh\/\">Edinburgh Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-parking-gatwick\/\">Gatwick Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-heathrow\/\">Heathrow Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-birmingham\/\">Birmingham Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-airport-stansted\/\">Stansted Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-southend\/\">Southend Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-airport-southampton\/\">Southampton Airport Meet and Greet<\/a><\/p>\n<p>ON ARRIVAL:<br \/>\n\u2022 Drive your own car to the meeting point outside the airport terminal<br \/>\n\u2022 A member of our friendly team, all of whom are professional, insured and CRB checked, will be waiting for your arrival<br \/>\n\u2022 Your driver will conduct a quick check over your car with you, they\u2019ll take photographs and then confirm your return details<br \/>\n\u2022 You are then free to take the short walk straight into departures to check in and catch your flight<br \/>\n\u2022 Our professional drivers will then drive and park your car for you, in our highly secure car parks, near to the airport, until your day of return<\/p>\n<p>ON YOUR RETURN:<br \/>\n\u2022 Call us when you have collected your luggage and are ready for your car.<br \/>\n\u2022 Your driver will meet you outside of the arrivals terminal with your car, exactly as you left it.<br \/>\n\u2022 Then simply drive home, or onto your next destination.<br \/>\nIt really is as simple as that!

But here are a few of the most important reasons;<br \/>\n\u2022 Fastest way to park at the airport \u2013 Because we park your car, it eliminates the whole parking process. Simply turn up to departures, walk in and we\u2019ll do the rest<br \/>\n\u2022 Easiest way to park at the airport \u2013 no parking to do, no shuttles to catch, no public transport to get &#8211; head straight to departures<br \/>\n\u2022 Safest way to park at the airport \u2013 for your car, which will be monitored 24\/7, and for yourself as you won\u2019t have to walk to far away car parks in the dark after a late flight<br \/>\n\u2022 Convenient for all travellers \u2013 you don\u2019t have to haul yourself, luggage, children, disability aids etc. onto shuttles or public transport.<br \/>\n\u2022 Cheap airport parking \u2013 meet and greet parking is MUCH cheaper than people think, it can often be cheaper than onsite airport parking<br \/>\n\u2022 Closest parking to the airport \u2013 Since you don\u2019t have to park your car, it\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll get to the terminal building than any other way of parking at the airport.<\/p>\n<p>WHO IS MEET AND GREET GOOD FOR?<br \/>\nMeet and greet parking can be used by any type of traveller but we describe below why it is particularly good for certain travellers depending on their needs<br \/>\n\u2022 Families \u2013 drive their own family cars with everything they need like buggy space and car seats, straight to the terminal. No hassle of hauling little ones around just to get to the airport<br \/>\n\u2022 Disabled \u2013 the best service for the less abled in our eyes.
