We, ordinarily, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/meet-and-greet-airport-parking\/\">meet and greet<\/a> our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/rewards-loyalty\/\">loyal<\/a> customers at most of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/\">airports in the UK,<\/a> ensuring their cars are safe and secure whilst they take a few days, weeks and even months away in other countries.<\/p>\n<p>As we all know many industries have suffered terribly through the pandemic. Mainly the industries that serve us outdoors, allow us to travel, explore, be with nature, eat and drink in different places apart from our own houses and gardens! On the flip side of this, the companies and industries that serve our indoors have boomed and prospered. We\u2019ve gardened, shopped online, made all kinds of things, watched ALL the series, had restaurant meal kits delivered so we can, for just a moment, feel like we are eating somewhere other than our own dining room!<\/p>\n<p>One thing we all haven\u2019t been able to do of course is travel, go abroad, fly to other countries whether to holiday, work or see family and friends. The travel industry has been hit hard by this pandemic, and big names like Flybe, STA Travel and even travel giants Thomas Cook have unfortunately gone into administration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Is there a new light at the end of the tunnel?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After a couple of years of being much quieter than usual, and fortunately keeping our heads above the water, we are starting to get phone calls and emails once again. In fact, since Monday, we have been pretty much inundated with airport parking enquiries, and even bookings, across all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/\">the airports <\/a>we offer parking and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/meet-and-greet-airport-parking\/\">meet and greet<\/a> at.\u00a0 This is no surprise to us to be honest as we have been following the \u2018roadmap\u2019 on tenterhooks, awaiting the day that the UK is allowed to travel and fly, once again.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign holidays are currently banned, as we know, but on Monday (3rd May) the British government announced that travel will be able to slowly resume, in the next few weeks, from May 17th!<\/p>\n<p>Of course many MPs, and the British public alike, are super wary of opening up too fast and then seeing a rise in cases once again, and it seems that Boris Johnson agrees with this too.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe do want to do some opening up on May 17 but I don\u2019t think that the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. I certainly don\u2019t and we have got to be very, very tough, and we have got to be as cautious as we can, whilst we continue to open up.\u201d <\/em>the Prime Minister is quoted as saying\u00a0 to reporters this week.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>So what travel restrictions have changed?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em>There will be further announcements, but at the moment, this is what we know.<\/p>\n<p>A traffic light system is going to be introduced where countries that we can travel to \/ from will be classed as GREEN, AMBER or RED.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you travel to a \u2018green country\u2019, you won\u2019t have to stay in a quarantine hotel or isolate whatsoever on your return, but you will need a negative covid test.<\/li>\n<li>If you travel to an \u2018amber country\u2019, you will need a negative covid test and have to isolate for 10 days, but again you won\u2019t have to stay in a quarantine hotel on your return.<\/li>\n<li>Travelling to \u2018red countries\u2019 will be the strictest, and only UK \/ Irish nationals will be able to return, as well as getting tested and having to stay and pay for a government quarantine hotel for 10 days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At the time of publishing this article, we still don\u2019t know what countries will be on the coveted \u2018green list\u2019 but there is much speculation running through every media outlet in the UK and Europe, with some suggesting that there will be at most a dozen countries only, which might include Portugal, Spain and perhaps Greece.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>So is it safe to book a holiday now?<\/strong> <\/em><\/p>\n<p>As we said, we have already received many airport parking bookings, especially at our busiest airports of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-airport-stansted\/\">Stansted<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-parking-gatwick\/\">Gatwick<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-heathrow\/\">Heathrow.<\/a> People are desperate to get some sunshine, to see family and friends abroad, and we very much expected it to be the case following the first announcement that travel restrictions would start to be lifted.<\/p>\n<p>We also think that it\u2019s because we offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/travel-support-during-covid-19\/\">travel support during covid-19<\/a>, and have completely rewritten our bookings and cancellation policy to move with these unpredictable times. Customers are now safe in the knowledge that, if their holiday or flight gets cancelled, they can change, edit and rearrange with <u>no penalties or charges. <\/u><\/p>\n<p>We think if you are really eager to book your holiday, please check the company&#8217;s cancellation and refund policies. Many, like ourselves, will have amended them to move with the current situation. However, many will not have and you don\u2019t want to book a holiday, flights, transfers and airport parking, if you then can\u2019t get anything back if covid strikes, yet again!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>What is Maple\u2019s new booking and cancellation policy?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As we said, you can now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/booking-with-maple-parking\/select-a-booking\/\">book airport parking <\/a>through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/\">Maple<\/a> with total flexibility and peace of mind.<\/p>\n<p>CHANGE, EDIT AND REISSUE YOUR BOOKING WITH NO PENALTIES\/CHARGES.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>ALL customers will be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/booking-with-maple-parking\/select-a-booking\/\">book airport parking<\/a> across our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/\">network of airports<\/a>, with the peace of mind that, should your travel dates change, there will be no change or reissuance fees. Only a difference in fare, if applicable, will apply.<\/li>\n<li>If you are not able to reissue your travel dates, we will happily give you a credit note for the same amount, to ensure you are able to book as and when your dates come through. This is again, completely free of charge.<\/li>\n<li>If you must cancel, simply give us 24 hours\u2019 notice and we will release your dates and offer you a full refund.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What are travel companies doing to keep customers safe from covid when they travel?<\/p>\n<p>This is another question and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/covid-19\/keeping-you-and-your-car-safe-with-maple-parking\/\">policy<\/a> we\u2019ve been working really hard on over the last few months.
