The surveys, which are available in English, Spanish and Chinese, evaluate air traveller experiences from check-in and arrivals through to shopping, entertainment, victuals, security and immigration, right through to departing at the gate. Completed by over 100 different nationalities, this year, over 13.7 million surveys were handed in at over 550 airports Worldwide between August 2017 and February 2018.<br \/>\nWe take a look around the winners, and since we park hundreds of cars at the UK airports every year, we want to know how our airports ranked, compared to all other airports in the World.<br \/>\nSo starting with the Top 5, the number one goes to\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong> 1 &#8211; SINGAPORE\u2019S CHANGI AIRPORT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1243\" src=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Singapore-300x91.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Singapore-300x91.png 300w, https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Singapore-768x234.png 768w, https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Singapore-1024x312.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Singapore.png 1267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2017 RATING \u2013 1<br \/>\nYEARLY PASSENGERS \u2013 62.2 million<br \/>\nNot only did it come first this year, it had been number one for last SIX consecutive years! What an incredible achievement, and when you look at the features, you can definitely see why;<br \/>\n\u2022 Connectivity \u2013 It offers free Wi-Fi (that actually works) as well as internet enabled computers that people can use free of charge. It also has free charging points everywhere so your own device will never die when on long transits and layovers at Changi.<br \/>\n\u2022 Entertainment \u2013From the large cinema screen and swimming pool, to the art \/ colouring desks, sports lounges and gaming rooms; this is one airport that you definitely won\u2019t get bored at! The entertainment features are seriously incredible, and probably one of the main reasons why they are keeping their number one spot.<br \/>\n\u2022 Nature \u2013 So nature and airports don\u2019t really go in the same sentence usually, they\u2019re juxtaposition in our minds. Not at Changi though, as they have a number of outdoor and green spaces to visit, including a butterfly garden (the very first in an airport), gardens with a plethora of ponds, flowers and plants, and even a sunflower garden! Get your Instagram at the ready, as they really are beautiful spaces.<br \/>\n\u2022 Comfort \u2013 Don\u2019t you hate it when you get stuck at an airport and there is nowhere to lie down apart from hard floors or chairs that induce sleepless neck bobbing. Well Changi have come up top here again, by offering snooze &amp; sanctuary lounges! They come with reclining chairs to lay weary bodies and, once again, completely free!<br \/>\n\u2022 Other features \u2013 include fantastic shopping and eateries, free city tours, art sculptures and much more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2 \u2013 INCHEON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (South Korea)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1244\" src=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/korea-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"368\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/korea-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/korea-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/korea.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2017 RATING \u2013 3<br \/>\nYEARLY PASSENGERS \u2013 62.1 million<br \/>\nFEATURES:<br \/>\n\u2022 State-of-the-art new Terminal 2, which was ready for the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games in February<br \/>\n\u2022 Robots (yes robots!) that help passengers navigate the airport and are able to communicate in four different languages, Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese.

Heathrow is also the highest ranking UK airport on the Top Airports in the World list, coming in 1 place higher than last year at number 8. So Heathrow does stand up there with the numbers, and also holds its own in the top list, but what extraordinary features does it have? Does it have lush green gardens, flight simulators, golf courses, swimming pools and robots too?<br \/>\nAbsolutely not! The only thing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-heathrow\/\">Heathrow<\/a> has got a lot of is designer shops, although they\u2019re the cream of the crop of shops to be fair from Harrods, Dior, Gucci, Paul Smith, Burberry, Prada, Versace and Cartier to the Caviar House, Prunier Seafood Bar and a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant.<br \/>\nPerhaps, in the UK, we don\u2019t need feature filled airports as maybe it\u2019s down to passengers spending longer at airports in the East because they\u2019re used more for layovers? Instead of just getting a flight, they are connecting flights, so are in the airport for anything from 1 hour to 24 hours. In our UK airports, we Brits especially, are only there for 1-3 hours unless something goes wrong and we are delayed. Do many other travellers actually lay over in the UK? Not really. The flight path of 1000\u2019s of long haul flights stop at Dubai, Changi, Doha and more, so they need all this entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe the best shopping and food experience, as well as cleanliness and airport service of course, is all we needed to rank in the top 20 with Heathrow? Do our other airports need to start upping their game after ranking so badly on this Top World Airport List?<br \/>\nHow did they actually do?<br \/>\n\u2022 London City \u2013 28 (up from 36 last year)<br \/>\n\u2022<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-parking-gatwick\/\"> London Gatwick<\/a> \u2013 54 (down from 51)<br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-birmingham\/\">Birmingham<\/a> \u2013 86 (down from 85)<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/airport\/airport-airport-stansted\/\">London Stansted<\/a> or Luton, no Manchester Airport, and not one Scottish airport on this list. Perhaps they need to follow in Heathrow\u2019s footsteps and, not necessarily flood loads of money on whacky features like Changi &amp; Hong Kong, but get up to speed with cleanliness and service first, because we and our visitors deserve a fantastic airport experience, on arrival and departure.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to at least arrive at the airport in the most convenient way, your own car, choose the easiest and most stylish way to park at an airport with us at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplemanorparking.net\/\">Maple Parking Meet and Greet Parking<\/a>; available at all UK airports 365 days a year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every year millions of air travellers take part in the largest global customer satisfaction survey, an independent study which culminates in an awards ceremony for Skytrax World Airport Awards.
