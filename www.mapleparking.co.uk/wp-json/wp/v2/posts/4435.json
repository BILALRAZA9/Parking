It\u2019s often been a tricky task, as it\u2019s been changing too!<\/p>\n<p>However, from the 4th October 2021, there will simply be <u>one red lis<\/u>t which is home to all the countries that are still suffering badly with Covid 19, and are a risk to the UK if masses travel to \/ from them.<\/p>\n<p>On this list of 54 countries there\u2019s much of South America, most of central and Southern Africa including South Africa itself, Thailand, Peru, Mayanmar, The Philippines, Afghanistan and more.<\/p>\n<p>Then, there\u2019s the \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list, which is basically all the rest of the countries in the World that we can (from the 4th October) travel to more easily.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s even better news for the fully vaccinated too, with quarantine, self-isolation, pre-departure and day 8 arrival tests all being scrapped for them.<\/p>\n<p>There are rules to being <em>fully<\/em> vaccinated such as travelling at least 14 days after vaccination and having approved vaccines only, so ensure that you check that you definitely qualify for <em>fully<\/em> vaccinated before you book.<\/p>\n<p>For the partially or unvaccinated, although you might still have to self isolate and have a negative PCR test before and after travel, the tests will be said to be a little cheaper, with chances to also have a test to release afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, just because the UK government says we can now travel to another country, that country might not want to accept us yet. It\u2019s super important to check both our government, and your destination\u2019s rules before flying.<\/p>\n<p>At Maple we are excited about these changes and we are ready to start parking more and more of our customers at the airports again. We are still running our long and short stay parking, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/meet-and-greet-airport-parking\/\">meet and greet parking<\/a> at all UK airports including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-airport-stansted\/\">Stansted<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-parking-gatwick\/\">Gatwick<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-heathrow\/\">Heathrow<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleparking.co.uk\/airport\/airport-birmingham\/\">Birmingham<\/a> airports.
