Call waiting times may be longer than usual.<\/p>\n<p>We know this is a difficult time for everyone and there are few real certainties about what will happen in the coming months.

For a start, now that our teams are working from home and the number of customer calls and emails being several times as many as normal, response times will be slower.<\/p>\n<p>As our booking staff are currently working from home \u2013 we are advising all of our customers to email us at bookings@mapleparking.co.uk with any queries and we will respond as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any queries or need to notify us of any changes to your travel plans \u2013 please first read Our cancellations, amendment and refund policy below.<\/p>\n<p>Call us on 03333 222 333 only if your query is urgent or relates to an imminent arrival or return within 3 days.<\/p>\n<h3>Our cancellations, amendment and refund policy<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Bookings made directly with Maple Parking<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Flexible bookings:<\/strong> As per our standard terms and conditions all flexible bookings can be amended cancelled up to 24 hours before the date and time booking is due to start. You must inform us by emailing bookings@mapleparking.co.uk to let us know that you would like to cancel.
