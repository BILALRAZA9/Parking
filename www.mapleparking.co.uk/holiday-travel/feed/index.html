										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve had traffic light systems, mandatory fit to fly and PCR tests, self isolation rules and costly and compulsory hotel quarantines. It’s safe to say that over the past few months and years, one of our favourite things to do, travel, hasn&#8217;t been easy. At some points it’s not even been possible! This has been a sad state of affairs for all travel companies like ours, airport parking. We definitely had quiet times when the travel restrictions were at their strictest, but fortunately travel has been picking up more and more over the last few months as more countries start opening their borders to us.</p>
<p>We also have some more good, actually great news! These travel restrictions and guidelines are being amended again on Monday 4th October, and this time they’re;</p>
<ul>
<li>More simple</li>
<li>Not as strict</li>
<li>Cheaper!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is really exciting for the airlines, travel companies, the airports themselves, us as an airport parking business, and yourselves as the people wanting to travel and go on holiday to lands afar (or further than the UK anyway!).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4436" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice.png" alt="Advice for Travel" width="925" height="618" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice.png 1169w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice-300x200.png 300w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice-1024x684.png 1024w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travel-Advice-768x513.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></p>
<p>The changes look positive, and although we advise everyone to listen to the full announcement on Monday, we want to give you a quick summary of what we can (hope!) to expect!</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye to the traffic light system</strong></p>
<p>We have had so many of our airport parking customers enquire about what list (green, amber or red) their destination is on. It’s often been a tricky task, as it’s been changing too!</p>
<p>However, from the 4th October 2021, there will simply be <u>one red lis</u>t which is home to all the countries that are still suffering badly with Covid 19, and are a risk to the UK if masses travel to / from them.</p>
<p>On this list of 54 countries there’s much of South America, most of central and Southern Africa including South Africa itself, Thailand, Peru, Mayanmar, The Philippines, Afghanistan and more.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the ‘rest of the world’ list, which is basically all the rest of the countries in the World that we can (from the 4th October) travel to more easily.</p>
<p>It’s even better news for the fully vaccinated too, with quarantine, self-isolation, pre-departure and day 8 arrival tests all being scrapped for them.</p>
<p>There are rules to being <em>fully</em> vaccinated such as travelling at least 14 days after vaccination and having approved vaccines only, so ensure that you check that you definitely qualify for <em>fully</em> vaccinated before you book.</p>
<p>For the partially or unvaccinated, although you might still have to self isolate and have a negative PCR test before and after travel, the tests will be said to be a little cheaper, with chances to also have a test to release afterwards.</p>
<p>Remember, just because the UK government says we can now travel to another country, that country might not want to accept us yet. It’s super important to check both our government, and your destination’s rules before flying.</p>
<p>At Maple we are excited about these changes and we are ready to start parking more and more of our customers at the airports again. We are still running our long and short stay parking, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet parking</a> at all UK airports including <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-airport-stansted/">Stansted</a>, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-parking-gatwick/">Gatwick</a>, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-heathrow/">Heathrow</a> and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-birmingham/">Birmingham</a> airports. We will also be maintaining our covid safe measures like extra cleanliness and social distancing as much as possible, as well as keeping our more flexible way of booking (if things do change again).</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you all again soon!</p>
<p>To book head to our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/">website</a>, email us <a href="mailto:bookings@mapleparking.co.uk">bookings@mapleparking.co.uk</a> at or call us on 03 333 222 333</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the biggest <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/about-us/">airport parking companies</a> in the UK, we are used to serving 100’s of holidaymakers, business travellers, and solo adventurers, daily. We, ordinarily, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet</a> our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/rewards-loyalty/">loyal</a> customers at most of the <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/">airports in the UK,</a> ensuring their cars are safe and secure whilst they take a few days, weeks and even months away in other countries.</p>
<p>As we all know many industries have suffered terribly through the pandemic. Mainly the industries that serve us outdoors, allow us to travel, explore, be with nature, eat and drink in different places apart from our own houses and gardens! On the flip side of this, the companies and industries that serve our indoors have boomed and prospered. We’ve gardened, shopped online, made all kinds of things, watched ALL the series, had restaurant meal kits delivered so we can, for just a moment, feel like we are eating somewhere other than our own dining room!</p>
<p>One thing we all haven’t been able to do of course is travel, go abroad, fly to other countries whether to holiday, work or see family and friends. The travel industry has been hit hard by this pandemic, and big names like Flybe, STA Travel and even travel giants Thomas Cook have unfortunately gone into administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Is there a new light at the end of the tunnel?</em></strong></p>
<p>After a couple of years of being much quieter than usual, and fortunately keeping our heads above the water, we are starting to get phone calls and emails once again. In fact, since Monday, we have been pretty much inundated with airport parking enquiries, and even bookings, across all <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/">the airports </a>we offer parking and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/meet-and-greet-airport-parking/">meet and greet</a> at.  This is no surprise to us to be honest as we have been following the ‘roadmap’ on tenterhooks, awaiting the day that the UK is allowed to travel and fly, once again.</p>
<p>Foreign holidays are currently banned, as we know, but on Monday (3rd May) the British government announced that travel will be able to slowly resume, in the next few weeks, from May 17th!</p>
<p>Of course many MPs, and the British public alike, are super wary of opening up too fast and then seeing a rise in cases once again, and it seems that Boris Johnson agrees with this too.</p>
<p><em>“We do want to do some opening up on May 17 but I don’t think that the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. I certainly don’t and we have got to be very, very tough, and we have got to be as cautious as we can, whilst we continue to open up.” </em>the Prime Minister is quoted as saying  to reporters this week.</p>
<p><strong><em>So what travel restrictions have changed?</em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em>There will be further announcements, but at the moment, this is what we know.</p>
<p>A traffic light system is going to be introduced where countries that we can travel to / from will be classed as GREEN, AMBER or RED.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you travel to a ‘green country’, you won’t have to stay in a quarantine hotel or isolate whatsoever on your return, but you will need a negative covid test.</li>
<li>If you travel to an ‘amber country’, you will need a negative covid test and have to isolate for 10 days, but again you won’t have to stay in a quarantine hotel on your return.</li>
<li>Travelling to ‘red countries’ will be the strictest, and only UK / Irish nationals will be able to return, as well as getting tested and having to stay and pay for a government quarantine hotel for 10 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of publishing this article, we still don’t know what countries will be on the coveted ‘green list’ but there is much speculation running through every media outlet in the UK and Europe, with some suggesting that there will be at most a dozen countries only, which might include Portugal, Spain and perhaps Greece.</p>
<p><em><strong>So is it safe to book a holiday now?</strong> </em></p>
<p>As we said, we have already received many airport parking bookings, especially at our busiest airports of <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-airport-stansted/">Stansted</a>, <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-parking-gatwick/">Gatwick</a> and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/airport-heathrow/">Heathrow.</a> People are desperate to get some sunshine, to see family and friends abroad, and we very much expected it to be the case following the first announcement that travel restrictions would start to be lifted.</p>
<p>We also think that it’s because we offer <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/travel-support-during-covid-19/">travel support during covid-19</a>, and have completely rewritten our bookings and cancellation policy to move with these unpredictable times. Customers are now safe in the knowledge that, if their holiday or flight gets cancelled, they can change, edit and rearrange with <u>no penalties or charges. </u></p>
<p>We think if you are really eager to book your holiday, please check the company&#8217;s cancellation and refund policies. Many, like ourselves, will have amended them to move with the current situation. However, many will not have and you don’t want to book a holiday, flights, transfers and airport parking, if you then can’t get anything back if covid strikes, yet again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What is Maple’s new booking and cancellation policy?</em></strong></p>
<p>As we said, you can now <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/booking-with-maple-parking/select-a-booking/">book airport parking </a>through <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/">Maple</a> with total flexibility and peace of mind.</p>
<p>CHANGE, EDIT AND REISSUE YOUR BOOKING WITH NO PENALTIES/CHARGES.</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL customers will be able to <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/booking-with-maple-parking/select-a-booking/">book airport parking</a> across our <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/airport/">network of airports</a>, with the peace of mind that, should your travel dates change, there will be no change or reissuance fees. Only a difference in fare, if applicable, will apply.</li>
<li>If you are not able to reissue your travel dates, we will happily give you a credit note for the same amount, to ensure you are able to book as and when your dates come through. This is again, completely free of charge.</li>
<li>If you must cancel, simply give us 24 hours’ notice and we will release your dates and offer you a full refund.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are travel companies doing to keep customers safe from covid when they travel?</p>
<p>This is another question and <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/covid-19/keeping-you-and-your-car-safe-with-maple-parking/">policy</a> we’ve been working really hard on over the last few months. The last thing we want is an outbreak between our customers and staff, and we only hope that all travel companies from airport buses and transfers, to airlines and the airports themselves will be following the strictest protocols when they start seeing more and more travellers come through their doors.</p>
<p><em>Here’s what </em><a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk"><em>Maple</em></a><em> have done to keep customers safe and to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Our new <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/covid-19/keeping-you-and-your-car-safe-with-maple-parking/">operating guidelines</a> will ensure that we always maintain social distancing as well as no contact for all drivers and passengers.</li>
<li>All staff will wear PPE and will administer hand sanitizer on their gloves before and after each customer AND vehicle interaction.</li>
<li>All staff have been fully trained to work in this different environment and to follow all of our new health and safety protocols.</li>
<li>Customers will be offered antibacterial wipes to use on their steering wheel, gear shift and hand controls prior to driving home.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the PMs’ announcement on February 22nd, we all have an extra spring in our step, and can see a little glimmer of light, in the hope that this summer, we could be enjoying holidays once more.</p>
<p>After what feels like a lifetime without travel, and the magic of seeing friends and family and enjoying the sun on our faces, we set to fly again and we imagine, travel deals will literally take off!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4088" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021.png" alt="" width="662" height="378" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021.png 1269w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021-300x171.png 300w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021-768x439.png 768w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Travel-2021-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></p>
<p><strong>All guidance is updated as often as possible in accordance with UK Government. Last updated February 23rd 2021.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do we know about holidays this year?</strong><br />
A decision about overseas travel will be made on April 12th. But Possibly as early as 17th May, if phase three begins and the success of the vaccine continues to head in the same direction.</p>
<p>UK holidays will resume in self-contained accommodation, and 12th April is also the date on which the Department for Transport will publish its review on when overseas travel can resume.</p>
<p><strong>Where will we be able to go?</strong><br />
There is a lot to consider, and it is important to get vaccinated to be welcomed without quarantine. What we know is that the usual holiday destinations like; Spain, Greece and Cyprus for example are keen to get us back, and so if the vaccine programmes continue and there are no new variants, it is realistic to expect to see the travel corridor open slowly but surely over the coming weeks.<br />
We also know that cruises are making headway too &#8211; and are actively making plans for vaccinated travellers to get back on board; this is good news for many who are waiting to rebook, or prefer getaways by sea.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine Rules</strong><br />
The vaccine is currently not mandatory, however The International Air Transport Association (IATA) have created a digital pass for those that have received the jab to verify their vaccination to Border Control forces. This acts as a ‘pass’ for travellers and would mean we would no longer need the hotel quarantines and mandatory tests as we currently have.<br />
There are also a number of travel operators who have confirmed that they won’t be turning away unvaccinated travellers, however, this does not mean that they visiting country share in the same vein.</p>
<p><strong>When can I book my holiday?</strong><br />
Anytime! although booking sooner rather than later could see you save BIG. It is likely that as time goes on, and demand increases, prices will rise quite dramatically.</p>
<p>At this time, holiday operators are offering attractive ‘get back travelling’ packages although with travel set to boom later this year, and with so many delaying their holidays, it’s looking busier than ever.</p>
<p>Be sure to spend some time getting the right insurance policy and a booking with a reputable travel company, and you should be covered for all eventualities – as many are offering flexible change and cancellation due to the shambles of 2020.</p>

<p>Everything you need to know about booking a trip this winter.</p>
<p>Crisp clear mountains and bright blue skies&#8230;dreaming!</p>
<p>We are all second guessing our accustomed normalities to escaping toward our winter wonderland. For some this is an annual essential, for others it is a persistent destination. Regardless of your circumstances, although daunting, the current safety of a trip this year is still very possible. Provided you search the correct places. There are many alternative resorts still open for you skiers, such as Germany and Italy, easily reached by rail or road.</p>
<p>Whilst skiing on the snowy alps are certainly less known, a lot can change from now to the start of the December season and again by its close at the end of April. In addition, Sweden and Greece are still possible though both are harder to reach without flying. Yet, if you are wanting a more guaranteed trip, why not head to the popular slopes of Scotland?</p>
<p>Scotland resorts could have their busiest winter’s yet, as they expect to accommodate an increase in visitors and locals too. Its resorts offer the best outdoor skiing and snowboarding in the UK. Surrounded by beautiful Highland and Aberdeenshire scenery, the ski centres are accessible from all of Scotland’s cities. With hire and lesson facilities, terrain parks, free car parks, restaurants, and ski shops at your favour, this is a great substitute for a holiday abroad.</p>
<p>Most resorts are establishing the details on how things will work, however basic rules will certainly be obligated. Such as wearing masks in lift queues, enclosed lifts, communal accommodation areas and indoor public spaces. Most resorts will also enforce an app to make reservations and food orders at restaurants. There is some variation, as well as following national guidelines, resorts and regions will unquestionably implement their own measures.</p>
<p>With 695 ski resorts, Germany has a nationwide programme to regularly test people working in travel and tourism this year. Social distancing and mask-wearing in communal areas will be the norm at hotels, hostels, and shared chalets. Alongside Italy’s covered cable cars, that will run at reduced capacity and at the highest possible speeds to reduce the time spent in the enclosed environment.</p>
<p>For both countries, the main concern is the dining aspects. Particularly in the tiny mountain huts or vast self-service places with the skiers packed onto benches. Although, this will hopefully be resolved with a minimum capacity, advanced bookings, and online apps to accelerate the process. They will also offer a wider variety of deliveries and takeaway options to accommodate everyone. It is also expected that self-catering will be the preferred choice for many.</p>
<p>Overall, all resorts are doing their best to comply with the governments guidelines as well as making this winter an enjoyable and viable retreat for all the annual skiers. Although advanced bookings are preferred, with the situation changing so regularly, last minute bookings to whichever snow-covered destination you choose, will be the way to go for most. It is also ideal to try and book in packages hence you are guaranteed a refund should something occur with result in cancellations.</p>
<p><strong>Ultimately, a snowy peaceful paradise is all still possible in 2021! Enjoy.<br />

<p>What a great feeling looking forward to your holiday, or ski trip, especially as the festive season is upon us and we all wind down for some much needed rest and re-charge.  Get peace of mind with our simple checklist of essentials, you do not want to forget anything and ruin your trip.</p>
<p>From making the most of your spends to making sure your passport is in date, get into the holiday spirit by using our list and checking off the must have travel essentials.</p>
<h3>Have to have, cannot holiday without!</h3>
<p><strong>Flights</strong>– Since ticket prices increase the closer you book to your departure date, it’s best to compare and book early where possible. Once you have your flight confirmations, be sure to p<span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; cursor: text; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">rint out copies of all of your flight tickets, as you might be required to display a return ticket when you check in. </span></p>
<p><strong>Your passport</strong> &#8211; at this time of year a renewal can take much longer, as many more plan to go away and realise that they need to renew their passport/travel documents.  May sure you check this out early and apply quickly and easily using the online service, or the check and send from the post office.  It really is much more simple these days and you cannot travel without one &#8211; don&#8217;t feel stressed, get it done, click here to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport">renew your adult passport</a> online.</p>
<p><strong>Your travel money</strong> &#8211; best to order currency in advance, or load it onto a money card.  There are many places to order currency, and it&#8217;s worth doing your home work to make sure you are getting the best rate. If you don&#8217;t want to travel with cash, a money card is a great alternative and is accepted in most places, with multi-currency options.  Must have!</p>
<p><strong>Travel insurance</strong> &#8211; Get protected, so important for that added peace-of-mind. Whether a city break, ski holiday or business trip, travel insurance is a must have, and can be found at reasonable cost.  Do not travel without it.</p>
<p><strong>Driving license</strong> &#8211; hiring a car, you will need a copy and the original of your license.  Email a copy to yourself too &#8211; just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Boarding pass</strong> &#8211; Be sure to check in, in good time.  Leaving it too late can actually leave you without a seat.  Airlines can oversell and it has been heard that passengers have had to wait for other flights, due to too many people and last one to check in.</p>
<p><strong>Phone charger</strong> / <strong>plug converter</strong> &#8211; consider which country you are travelling too and ensure you have the right converter/charger to keep your phone&#8217;s battery full.</p>
<p><strong>Parking at the airport before you travel.</strong></p>
<p><span class="st">If you have booked your holiday in advance, take care of your airport parking at the same time.<br />
By pre-booking your <em>parking</em> space you have one less thing to worry about, leaving you to concentrate <em>on</em> the <em>holiday</em> ahead.  When you pre-book you will also save, the sooner you book the cheaper it will be.  Get a <a href="http://A pre-booked parking space means you have one less thing to worry about on the day of your flight, leaving you to concentrate on the holiday ahead.">meet and greet parking quote</a> here.</span></p>
