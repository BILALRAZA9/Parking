										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What do Approved Parking Operators offer?</strong></p>
<p>Approved by Trading Standards, every approved operator is required to demonstrate that their parking facilities meet planning and security requirements&#8230;how?</p>
<p>With Maple Parking Meet and Greet you know your car is in safe hands. Our car parks are<a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/latest-news/park-mark-award/"> Park Mark</a> accredited and have CCTV, flood lights and security fences. All our drivers are fully insured to drive your car between the airport and the car park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Approved Operator Scheme’ at Gatwick Airport</strong></p>
<p>The scheme provides security for the many drivers who choose to park in offsite car parks, and gives the assurance that the company is upholding a set of safety guidelines that comply with the minimum customer service standards and to ensure all passengers can identify these operators.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-583" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gatwick-approved-operator.png" alt="Gatwick Approved Operator" width="276" height="200" srcset="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gatwick-approved-operator.png 340w, https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gatwick-approved-operator-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<p>Gatwick introduced this scheme some time ago and if a car park fulfiled a number of criteria they would be rewarded with Gatwick-approved status. In order to be approved, all car parks are required too:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adhere to the <a href="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/latest-news/park-mark-award/">Park Mark</a> Safer Parking Scheme</li>
<li>West Sussex Trading Standards Buy With Confidence Scheme ( a list of businesses what commit to trading fairly)</li>
<li>Operate within agreement of Gatwick Airport.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2394 size-full" src="https://www.mapleparking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BWC-logo-004-1.png" alt="Trading Standards Approved" width="220" height="107" /></p>
<p>This scheme provides customers with a list businesses that have committed to trading fairly, and is a direct response to rogue traders. Every business has undergone a series of detailed checks in order to be approved.</p>
<p>Maple Parking are proud to be fully accredited by the authorities, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gatwick Airport Approved Operators Scheme</li>
<li>West Sussex Trading Standards Buy With Confidence Scheme</li>
<li>British Parking Association</li>
<li>Park Mark awarded parking facilities</li>
</ul>
